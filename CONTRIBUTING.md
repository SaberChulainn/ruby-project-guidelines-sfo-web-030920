# Contributing to Trivia

Thanks for taking an interest in our small project. Here are the steps if you would like to contribute as well

# Create a new Branch

Before making any changes please make a new branch with the name specify on what you want to change or add
This will help ensure that we are able to know the commits that are being merged

# Commits 

Make sure commits are brief and a clear summary of what you have changed or wrote.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go
ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

* Fork this repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo

Either Ed or I will go through the pull to overview what would be merged.
