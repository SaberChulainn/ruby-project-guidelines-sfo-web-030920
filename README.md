# Module One Final Project Guidelines

Welcome to our random trivia project!

Our game will allow the user to play a game of random trivia.

During the welcome screen, you are prompted to your own name or username

You can enter a username and it'll either bring up your account info or create one for you!

Afterwards you are prompted to either type start_game, show_points, or exit

You can look at your current points on your account, start a brand new game or quit the application.
