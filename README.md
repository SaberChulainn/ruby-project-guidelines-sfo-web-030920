# Module One Final Project Guidelines

Welcome to our random trivia project!

Our game will allow the user to play a game of random trivia.

During the welcome screen, you are prompted to your own name or username

You can enter a username and it'll either bring up your account info or create one for you!

Afterwards you are prompted to either type start_game, show_points, or exit

You can look at your current points on your account, start a brand new game or quit the application.

# Playing the game

You will be dealt a series of questions during the game.

These questions can be ranked from easy, medium or hard!

Each question is worth 100 points! Make sure to answer it correctly, or else you can lose 100 points as well.

You are able to end the current game as well by typing exit!

# Hope you enjoy our project! Thanks for playing :)
